# Write a program that loops through all files inside 'src_folder' and moves them to 'dst_folder'
# You can define src_folder and dst_folder by going to a folder on your computer and copying the path (look up a tutorial if you are stuck)


# specify the source and destination folder paths
src_folder = '/path/to/src/folder'
dst_folder = '/path/to/dst/folder'
