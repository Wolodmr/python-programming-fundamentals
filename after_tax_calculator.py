## 1. Ask user for gross income (per year). Remember to convert the value to float.
## 2. If the income is below 10000, the user is exempt from tax hence the program should print the same value as it received as input
# 3. The country has tax brackets as follows:
# a: income between 10000 and 30000 is taxed at 20%
# b: income at 30000 to 50000 is taxed at 35%
# c: income over 50000 is taxed at 45% 
# 4. Calculate the user's after-tax income using if/elif/else statements.
